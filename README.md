An example of semantic HTML.
This is a website regarding Search Engine Optimization. It gives information on how to increase visibility and accessibility to your site.
I am altering the div tags in the code, without changing the appearance of the website. I am also adding alt descriptions to the images, so that text descriptions can be seen if the images do not load.

The link for the website is: [https://jbobrick12.github.io/restructuring-html/](https://jbobrick12.github.io/restructuring-html/)
